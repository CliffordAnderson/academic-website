abstract = "In this contribution to the roundtable, *Creating and Keeping Medieval Scholarship: A Consideration of Digital and Traditional Methods*, I argue from a library and information science perspective that Laura Morreale's [Digital Documentation Process](https://digitalhumanitiesddp.com/) provides a collaborative means for curating digital scholarship data while also preserving representations of those projects. This paper discusses its application to Lynn Ramey's [digital edition of Jean Bodel's Les Congés](https://bodelconges.vanderbilt.edu/) and suggests minor improvements to the process."
