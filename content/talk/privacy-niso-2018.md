abstract = "How can librarians effectively teach patrons about digital privacy? How does instruction about digital privacy fit within a scholarly communications program? In the fall 2017, the Vanderbilt University Library experimented with a three part series on digital privacy, covering the concepts of encrypting communications, browsing the web anonymously, and keeping operating systems secure. In his session, we will reflect on the success of the program, its limitations, and how we plan to refine our privacy outreach to students in the future."
