Continuing a long-standing cooperative relationship, ATLA and Vanderbilt University’s Divinity Library have contributed funding to support the open access publication of an edited volume in De Gruyter’s series on Introductions to Digital Humanities: Religion. The volumes in the series address “specific areas of study at the intersections of digital humanities & religion, offering an overview of current methodologies, techniques, tools, and projects as well as defining challenges and opportunities for further research.”

Clifford B. Anderson, Associate University Librarian for Research and Learning at Vanderbilt University and Individual member of ATLA, is editing the forthcoming fifth volume, titled Digital Humanities and Libraries and Archives in Religious Studies. Several chapters are also being authored by librarians at ATLA member institutions. The book, expected to be published in 2019, explores topics such as digital humanities pedagogy in theological libraries and archives and the visualization of data from religious and theological collections.

Clifford explains that “digital humanities is becoming an important part of librarianship generally and this publication provides an opportunity for theological librarians to chart their own course in this rapidly-developing field. By publishing this volume in open access, I hope that it will gain wide readership among members of the ATLA and among practitioners of religious and theological librarianship from other regions of the world.” [Read more ...](https://newsletter.atla.com/2018/vanderbilt-openaccess/)
